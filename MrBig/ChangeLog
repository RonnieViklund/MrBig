050130	Rewrote procs.c so the same code can run on NT4 and W2K. This
	requires psapi.dll, which is a free download on NT4.
	Added Windows version and MrBig version to cpu status message.
	In cpu.c: get_load() works for NT4 and W2K and reads
	load average from registry.

041210	Updated readcfg in mrbig.c to handle spaces in values, e.g. paths.

041207	Changed the [services] header in mrbig.cfg.dist to [svcs].

041125	Added -t option to run standalone (not as service) for testing.
	Fixed potential divide by zero in cpu.c.
	Wrote a sample mrbig.cfg.dist with all sections and removed
	the other cfg files.

041124	Use "double quotes" to specify display names rather than
	service names in the configuration. It is not allowed to
	mix service and display names.

041123	Added [headers] to the configuration format.
	New .include directive in the configuration file.
	New .config directive gets configuration from server.
	Writes cached config to C:\windows\system32\cfg.cache.
	New minibbd server logs received messages to stdout.
	New minicfg server to test .config directive.
	Call WSAStartup only when the service starts and
	WSACleanup only when it is stopped.

041025	In cpu.c: print memory statistics using double rather than
	long to avoid overflow.
	In mrbig.c: allow multiple displays.
	Released 0.3.2.

041015	Removed every single instance of sprintf, strcpy and
	strcat, even where buffer overflow is impossible.
	The new function snprcat works like snprintf but prints
	at the end of the string rather than the beginning.
	Changed start type from DEMAND to AUTO in CreateService call.
	Released 0.3.1.

041012	Individual yellow and red levels for filesystems in disk.cfg.
	In disk.c: Show which filesystems have error conditions.
	In cpu.c: Added "Machine recently rebooted" lines.
	Moved get_uptime into cpu.c and removed uptime.c.
	Moved pscount into cpu.c and removed pscount.c.
	Moved users into cpu.c and removed users.c.
	Fixed up the formats of the various tests to better match
	the original.
	Figured out the horrible code that must be fixed in Larrd
	to make memory graphs work. See LARRD.
	Released 0.3.0.

041010	Logging functions to open and close files.
	Added status code explanations to the svcs test.

041009	Use Mingw rather than Cygwin to compile. Minor changes to
	mrsend() to use winsock2 rather than bsd socket.

041007	Fixed memory leaks. Logging memory management functions,
	define DEBUG_MEMORY to use.
	Released 0.1.0.

041006	Finally figured out how to calculate CPU load (cpu.c).
	Fixed the uptime display in cpu.c.
	Fixed the capacity percentage in disk.c
	Added external tests (ext_test.c)

041006	Released 0.0.2.

041005	Added event log scanning. Filter based on type, source or message.
	Replaced ad-hoc registry reading code with read_perfcounters.
