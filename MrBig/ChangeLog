051121	When sending reports to several displays, sleep for 10
	seconds between each.
	Released 0.10.0.

051111	Terminate each report with \n\0 rather than \n. This is
	what Quest's client does.

051025	Always sleep at least SLEEP_MIN seconds between loops.


050712	Added buffer overrun detection to big_malloc et al.

050708	Handle unexpected time changes rationally. Released 0.8.1.

050707	mrbig.c: new function insert_status keeps track of changes
	in test status so that the main loop can be run more often
	without sending more reports to the bbdisplay.
	Added shutdown() call to mrsend, as suggested by msdn.
	New variable mrloop regulates how often the main loop runs.
	New configuration option controls mrloop.
	Released 0.8.0.

050705	readlog.c: handle the case that RegQueryValueEx may not
	null-terminate the result.

050615	Modified the event log code for w2003.

050530	cfg.c, mrbig.c: Removed bind directive under [mrbig] and added
	global directive .bind instead. Tankevurpa.

	Released 0.7.1.

050530	msgs.c: New directive filters on event id.
	Example: ignore id 1000

	cfg.c, mrbig.c: New directive to bind local address (useful
	when there are more than one interfaces).  This goes under
	the [mrbig] section in mrbig.cfg, before any .configure lines.
	Example: bind 10.0.35.20

	Released 0.7.0.

050510	Added lots of debugging output.

050227	Introduced strlcat.c and strlcpy.c from OpenBSD.

050224	Let mrlog print to stderr if running standalone.

050201	cpu.c: New formula to calculate memory usage.
	Release 0.5.0.

050131	cpu.c: New version of pscount() which doesn't require
	W2K registry.
	Check each read_perfcounters() call for NULL results.

050130	Rewrote procs.c so the same code can run on NT4 and W2K. This
	requires psapi.dll, which is a free download on NT4.
	Added Windows version and MrBig version to cpu status message.
	In cpu.c: get_load() works for NT4 and W2K and reads
	load average from registry.

041210	Updated readcfg in mrbig.c to handle spaces in values, e.g. paths.

041207	Changed the [services] header in mrbig.cfg.dist to [svcs].

041125	Added -t option to run standalone (not as service) for testing.
	Fixed potential divide by zero in cpu.c.
	Wrote a sample mrbig.cfg.dist with all sections and removed
	the other cfg files.

041124	Use "double quotes" to specify display names rather than
	service names in the configuration. It is not allowed to
	mix service and display names.

041123	Added [headers] to the configuration format.
	New .include directive in the configuration file.
	New .config directive gets configuration from server.
	Writes cached config to C:\windows\system32\cfg.cache.
	New minibbd server logs received messages to stdout.
	New minicfg server to test .config directive.
	Call WSAStartup only when the service starts and
	WSACleanup only when it is stopped.

041025	In cpu.c: print memory statistics using double rather than
	long to avoid overflow.
	In mrbig.c: allow multiple displays.
	Released 0.3.2.

041015	Removed every single instance of sprintf, strcpy and
	strcat, even where buffer overflow is impossible.
	The new function snprcat works like snprintf but prints
	at the end of the string rather than the beginning.
	Changed start type from DEMAND to AUTO in CreateService call.
	Released 0.3.1.

041012	Individual yellow and red levels for filesystems in disk.cfg.
	In disk.c: Show which filesystems have error conditions.
	In cpu.c: Added "Machine recently rebooted" lines.
	Moved get_uptime into cpu.c and removed uptime.c.
	Moved pscount into cpu.c and removed pscount.c.
	Moved users into cpu.c and removed users.c.
	Fixed up the formats of the various tests to better match
	the original.
	Figured out the horrible code that must be fixed in Larrd
	to make memory graphs work. See LARRD.
	Released 0.3.0.

041010	Logging functions to open and close files.
	Added status code explanations to the svcs test.

041009	Use Mingw rather than Cygwin to compile. Minor changes to
	mrsend() to use winsock2 rather than bsd socket.

041007	Fixed memory leaks. Logging memory management functions,
	define DEBUG_MEMORY to use.
	Released 0.1.0.

041006	Finally figured out how to calculate CPU load (cpu.c).
	Fixed the uptime display in cpu.c.
	Fixed the capacity percentage in disk.c
	Added external tests (ext_test.c)

041006	Released 0.0.2.

041005	Added event log scanning. Filter based on type, source or message.
	Replaced ad-hoc registry reading code with read_perfcounters.
