Mr Big Monitoring Agent
-----------------------

Read this file in Wordpad if the linewrapping looks strange.


Installation
------------
Unzip the archive in a suitable directory, e.g:

md C:\MrBig
cd C:\MrBig
unzip \path\to\archive.zip

To install and start the service, run the commands:

mrbig -i
net start MrBig

By default the service is started automatically during system startup.
This can be changed using the Services panel in Windows.


Stop the service before uninstalling, like this:

net stop MrBig
mrbig -u


Configuration
-------------
The archive comes with sample configuration files. You'll want
to at least create the main configuration file, mrbig.cfg. The
"machine" and "display" parameters have the most stupid defaults
and are thus the most important to change.

A suitable mrbig.cfg for a server might look like this:

8<---
machine myserver.qbranch.se
port 1984
display 10.0.4.5
sleep 300
8<---

Use the lines between the scissors.

It is not necessary to restart the service after changing the
configuration.

There can be more than one display.

Rather than placing configuration directives in several files,
all configuration can be stored in mrbig.cfg. Headers in
[square brackets] are used to separate the targets. MrBig
understands these headers:

[mrbig]

The [mrbig] header is used for global settings. Any settings
that appear before the first header are treated as global.

[disk]

[msgs]

[ext]

[svcs]

[procs]

Configuration can also be split into several files by using the
.include directive, like this:

.include C:\MrBig\myconfig.txt


Configuration daemon
--------------------
An optional configuration daemon allows several clients to
be administered from a single place. If the daemon is running
on host 10.0.4.5, port 1985, the clients only need a single
line in mrbig.cfg:

.config 10.0.4.5 1985

The downloaded configuration is cached so that the client
can continue running even if the configuration daemon
is unavailable. The name of the cache file is
C:\windows\system32\cfg.cache.
