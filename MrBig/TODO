procs: add severity level (color) to the config format

---

Use printError from procs.c more.

Add another meta directive: .quote

.quote Rest of string

This adds "Rest of string" to the configuration. The purpose is
to allow e.g. .include directives in the minicfg configuration
as well as locally. That would be:

.quote .include C:\my\local\file.cfg

Invent a proxy protocol that allows remote clients to get
their configuration from minicfg.

Idea: the client connects to the proxy. The proxy connects
to minicfg. Minicfg looks up the proxy's IP address and opens
its configuration file. If the first line is ".proxy filename",
we know that it is a proxy. Minicfg reads the real client's IP
address from the socket and proceeds to read the file from the
.proxy directive. The file contains a simple access list,
governing access to the client configurations the proxy is
allowed to fetch. The access list format is similar to the
ones in IOS, but with an address mask instead of a wildcard
mask:

permit 10.0.7.0 255.255.255.0
deny 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0
permit 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

At the end is an implicit deny.

However, this does not work. There is no guarantee that the
clients IP addresses are unique if they are sitting behind
a proxy; indeed, the reason for the proxy is probably to
avoid the need for unique addresses. We must therefore use
separate configuration directories for the proxied clients.
