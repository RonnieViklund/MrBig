Ext tests are listed in ext.cfg. Tests are run sequentially using
CreateProcess. The test must finish within two minutes or it
will be terminsted. Finally check the pickup directory for any files.

This way the ext scripts must finish within the time allocated
for the main loop of MrBig. That shouldn't normally be a problem
unless the tests are badly written. In that case fix the tests.
Otherwise there is no way to keep this client from loading down
the operating system unacceptably.

After all tests have been run, look in the pickup directory
for files. The filename indicates the name of the test. The
first line is the status. The machine name is always taken
from the mrmachine variable, so there is no way to make tests
on behalf of other clients. That limitation is also present
in the original Big Brother client, afaik.

Add something like this to mrbig.cfg to activate ext tests:

pickupdir C:\mrbig\pickup
